A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables. 
Here, the relational database contains one table. 

A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
 Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. Here the table is celebs. 



 CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type,           <--- mySQL statement
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);

CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.

table_name refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.

(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) is a parameter. A parameter is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.

SELECT name AS 'Titles'
FROM movies;

AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using an alias. The new name can be anything you want as long as you put it inside of single quotes. Here we renamed the name column as Titles.

It is important to remember that the columns have not been renamed in the table. The aliases only appear in the result.


///

SELECT DISTINCT genre
FROM movies;             <----- will return a few results rather than 250



/////

SELECT *
FROM MOVIES 
WHERE imdb_rating < 5;   <----- properly querying the database


//////


SELECT *
FROM MOVIES
WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en'; <-------- Has these letters


We can use the % character like so: WHERE name LIKE 'A%'; returns all names starting with A. WHERE name LIKE '%man%'; returns all names where man is in the name.

SELECT name 
FROM movies 
WHERE imdb_rating IS NULL;


//////////////


SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';


BETWEEN two letters is not inclusive of the 2nd letter.
BETWEEN two numbers is inclusive of the 2nd number.




////////////

SELECT *
FROM movies 
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979 
AND imdb_rating > 8;  <---- further query

SELECT * 
FROM movies 
WHERE genre = 'romance'
  OR genre = 'comedy';


  //////////////


  SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE imdb_rating > 8
ORDER BY year DESC;

DESC is a keyword used in ORDER BY to sort the results in descending order (high to low or Z-A).

ASC is a keyword used in ORDER BY to sort the results in ascending order (low to high or A-Z).

Note: ORDER BY always goes after WHERE (if WHERE is present).
